# Database README

I have provided data via a sqlite database. It can be found on [OneDrive](https://uic365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/erhlango_uic_edu/EaeVtM_p_eVEjzAHixZ5YrQBAUpI2nPtvgXcpYoJr1ZT3Q?e=RqbF0h). This should be downloaded and placed in this folder.

## License

You may use this database for your own personal use after the class is completed but please do not redistribute it publicly.

## Schema

Five tables are provided:

### assessments

Built from numerous FOIA requests, this table includes information on assessments for residential properties from 2011 to 2021. 2022 tentative assessments are also included.

### blight

See: https://data.detroitmi.gov/datasets/blight-violations/explore
 Blight Violation Notices (BVN), or Blight Tickets, that have been issued to property owners who have violated City of Detroit ordinances that govern how property owners must maintain the exterior of their property. Blight Tickets are issued by city inspectors, police officers, neighborhood city hall managers and other city officials who investigate complaints of blight and are managed by the Department of Administrative Hearings. Blight tickets that are issued may be subsequently voided by the ticket writing department for various reasons.
